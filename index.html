<p class="lead">This academic year some pupils at <a href="http://www.stocktonprimary.co.uk">Stockton on the Forest Primary School</a> have been working with <a href="https://twitter.com/edwardandrews">Edward Andrews-Hodgson</a> to learn about coding.</p>
<p class="lead">They've written some webpages we're showing off here. Not all the pages are finished, but they're still worth a look!</p>
<p>Many thanks to Edward's employer, <a href="http://www.yoomee.com">Yoomee</a>, for allowing him time off each week to run the club.</p>
